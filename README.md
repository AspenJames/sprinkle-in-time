# Sprinkle In Time

## What it is

Plain and simple, a ridiculous(ly fake) e-commerce website for an amazing(ly
fake) business. **Sprinkle In Time** is an innovative, future-thinking company.
We understand what consumers *will* want in the near future. Our patented
watches will be the next hot product sweeping the markets. The watches, while
stylish, have a hidden feature - jazzing up your snacks with colorful edible
sprinkles! **You** can be the first of your friends to get your very own
*Sprinkle In Time* watch. Be sure to sign up for our mailing list and read our
blog to keep up with the latest breaking news and trends in futuristic
functional fashion.

## The technologies

This is built using [Sinatra][sinatra], [ActiveRecord][ar], and
[SQLite][sqlite]. It's a very lightweight web application with very few
dependencies. The goal was to make a ridiculous website using lightweight and
minimal technologies. Ideally, there would be no CSS dependencies, but I'm
pretty bad at CSS so I'm choosing to use a lightweight framework -
[Milligram][mg]. I'm also consuming that via a [CDN][cdn], so that doesn't add
any weight to the server.

## The License

[GNU Affero General Public License][agpl]. I think it's a great license, and
the [GNU Philosophy][gnu-phil] is just a great way to approach software
licensing. If you don't like this license, that's ok.

## Wanna use the code?

Totally do it. [Fork it][fork], build on top of it, break it, go nuts. Just
please kindly keep the **License** attached.

## Interested in more?

Wow, thank you! I really appreciate the interest. I've got a [terminal-based
kanban application][tknbn] that I'm developing at the same time as this
application, and I'm pretty excited about it. It's using Ruby and Curses to
create a fairly feature-rich terminal-based kanban app that you can simply
(once I push the alpha out) `gem install tknbn; tknbn` to install and run. I
also have a [Dev.to][dev] blog that you can read if you're interested. The only
social media I use are [Keybase.io][kb], [Twitter][tweet], and [LinkedIn][in] -
feel free to reach out on any.
